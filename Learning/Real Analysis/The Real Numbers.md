# The Real Numbers

The **real numbers**:

- are an ordered field
- contains $\mathbb Q$ as a subfield
- have the property that all subsets that is bounded above in $\mathbb R$ has a supremum in R.

Let $A$ be a subset of $\mathbb Q$. We say $A$ is a **cut** when the following statements are true:

- for $x, y \in \mathbb Q$, if $x \in A$ and $y < x$ , then $y \in A$
- for $x \in \mathbb Q$, if $x \in A$, there exists $z \in A$ so that $z > x$
- $A \ne \{\}$ and $A \ne \mathbb Q$

Let $p \in \mathbb Q$, $(q)_{R*}$ denote the following cut: $\{x \in \mathbb Q | x < p\}$
