## Object-Oriented Analysis

### Domain Models

A **domain model** is a representation of real-situation conceptual classes

- not a software object
- shows the noteworthy domain concepts or object
- one of OO artifacts

### Conceptual Class

- (Informal) Definition: A conceptual class is an idea, thing, or object
- (More formal) Definition: A conceptual class may be considered in terms of its symbol, intension, and extension
    - *Symbol*: Words or images representing a conceptual class.
    - *Intension*: The definition of a conceptual class.
    - *Extension*: The set of examples to which the conceptual class applies.

### Associations Between Conceptual Classes

An **association** is a relationship between classes that indicate some meaningful and interesting connection

## System Sequence Diagrams

A visualisation of the system events that external actors generate, the order of the events, and possible inter-system events

- One SSD is for one particular scenario of a use case
- Helps to identify the external input events to the system (the system events)
- Treats system as a ‘black box’ to describe what the system does without explaining how it does it.
