# NoSQL Databases

Traditional Relational Databases: Schema on Write

NoSQL: Schema on Read

## Features

- does not use relational model or SQL language
- runs well on distributed servers
- most are open-source
- built for the modern web
- schema-less (implicit schema)
- support schema on read
- no ACID compliant
- eventually consistent

## Types

## Key-Value Stores

Key = primary key, Value = anything

Example: Redis

## Document Stores

document is json file

Example: MongoDB

## Columns Families

columns rather than rows stored on disk

related columns grouped together as families

Example: Cassandra

## Graph Databases

a node-and-arc network

graphs are difficult to program in relational database

Example: Neo4j
