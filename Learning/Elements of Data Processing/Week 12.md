# Week 12

## Big Data Analytics

Technical definition: The ability to collect, store, and process increasingly large and complex data sets from a variety of sources, into competitive advantage.

Big data management capabilities: Volume, Variety and Velocity (3Vs) + Veracity (4Vs)

Positive Outcomes:

- tracking criminals
- higher product margins
- new business models
- improved health care

Negative Outcomes:

- misuse of personal information
- breaching privacy
- profiling of individuals
- discrimination

Process steps in big data analytics:

- Data extraction
    - Consent is not always provided for data extraction, often people don't know their data are being extracted and used. Extractions involved unprecedented incursions into our everyday like and so legally and socially undefended territory. Those who are providing the data are not paid for it.
- Data commodification
    - Data are analysed, processed and aggregated into secondary markets with hidden value chains and people can purchase information about others without their consent.
- Decision making
    - Decision-making models are based on representations of you which may not be correct and will be partial (eg how you represent yourself on Instagram, Tik Tok or Facebook); the information also loses the context within which the information was collected (eg perhaps your comment was sarcastic, or your searches were related to work rather than your personal life or opinions). The information may also be old e.g. from when you were a child, and it is difficult to redefine yourself online as everything is saved and available. Decision-making models use correlations to make causational predictions. Decision-making models are based on the average trend, so may not incorporate outliers. Finally, decision-making models can have a lot of power or impact on a person's life eg whether you are given a loan, the price of your insurance, your credit history, job screening and so on.
- Control and monitoring
    - Surveillance is the opposite of trust-based relationships and so erodes social trust. Big companies know a lot about lots of people which gives them a lot of power, particularly as they know everything about who you are, what you are, where you like to go, who you know, and so on, which can be disastrous, depending on the country a person lives in, or if your currently liberal country changes.
- Experiments
    - Experiments are now often run online without the permission of the 'participants' who are not able to provide consent. There is little regulation to 'punish' companies who do not follow regulations often happen behind the scenes without anyone's awareness, including regulators or the public
