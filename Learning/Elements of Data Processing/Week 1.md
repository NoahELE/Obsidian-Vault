# Week 1

a measure of central tendency:

- mean
- median
- mode

a measure for spread of data:

- standard deviation
- range
- variance
- interquartile range

## Line Chart

Reflect how the data change.

## Boxplot

- Median: the middle data point
- Quartile 1 (Q1): the middle point below the median
- Quartile 3 (Q3): the middle point above the median
- Interquartile range (IQR): Q3 - Q1

- Upper limit: Q3 + 1.5 \* IQR
- Upper inner fence: the highest data point below upper limit
- Lower limit: Q1 - 1.5 \* IQR
- Lower inner fence: the lowest data point above lower limit

- Suspected outliers (circle): 1.5 \* IQR above Q3 or below Q1
- Outliers (solid dot): 3 \* IQR above Q3 or below Q1

## Histogram

Frequency distribution of a set of continuous data points.

Only sensible to be ordered in one way.

important to choose an appropriate bin width:

- to small: normal objects in empty/rare bins, false positive;
- to large: outliers in some frequent bins, false negative;

## Bar Chart

Summarise data points over a categorical variable.

Can be in any order.

## Scatter Plot

A dot is a data point with 2 values

Reflects the relationship between 2 variables.

Outliers: the data points which doesn't fit in the line of best fit.

### Bubble Plot

Use the size of circle around the data point as a3rd value to reflect relationship between 3 values.

Can also use the intensity of color.

### Scatter Plot Matrix

A matrix of all pairs of variables.

Convenient for spotting patterns and outliers.

### Overplotting

- reducing data point size
- sampling
- jitter

## Heat Map

- plot the data matrix
- individual values are represented as colors

## Parallel Coordinates

each data sample is represented by a connected line

scales can lead to misinterpretation
