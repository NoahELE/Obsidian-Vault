# Week 2

## Data Quality and Preprocessing

Data quality:

- Accuracy
- Completeness
- Consistency
- Timeliness
- Believability
- Interpretability

## Missing Data and Imputation

### Missing Completely at Random (MCAR)

The probability of missing data on a variable is unrelated to any other measured variable and is unrelated to the variable with missing values itself.

### Missing at Random (MAR)

The probability of missing data on a variable is related to other fully measured variables

### Missing Not at Random (MNAR)

The missing value on a variable are related to the values of that variable itself, even after controlling for other variables

### Simple Missing Data Strategies

statistical measurement imputation:

- mean
- median
- mode

> Pro: easy to compute and administer; no loss of records
>
> Con: biases other statistical measurements like variance and standard deviation

## Structured Format: Relational Databases and Algebra

Data formats:

more human readable ------ more machine readable

| Unstructured         | Semi-Structured | Structured   |
| -------------------- | --------------- | ------------ |
| Text files\Documents | XML             | Databases    |
| Audio                | JSON            | Tables       |
| Video                | Webpages        | Spreadsheets |
| Social media data    | CSV, NoSQL      | ……           |

## Semi-structured Format (CSV, HTML, XML)

## Semi-structured Format (JSON) and Intro Unstructured Text
