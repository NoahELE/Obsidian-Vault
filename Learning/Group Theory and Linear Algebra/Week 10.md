## The Spectral Theorem

- (Transformation version) Let $f: V \to V$ be a normal linear transformation on a finite-dimensional complex inner product space $V$ . Then $V$ has an orthonormal basis $\mathcal B$ such that $[f]_{\mathcal B}$ is a diagonal matrix.
- (Matrix version) Given a complex normal matrix $A$, there exists a complex isometry (aka unitary) matrix $U$ such that $U^{-1}AU$ is diagonal.
