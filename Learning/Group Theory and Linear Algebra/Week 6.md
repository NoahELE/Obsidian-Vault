# Week 6

## Subgroup Generated by a Set and Order of Elements

Let $S$ be a subset of a group $G$. The subgroup of $G$ generated by S, denoted $\langle S \rangle$, is the smallest subgroup of $G$ containing all the elements of $S$, that is:

- $\langle S \rangle$ is a subgroup of $G$
- if $H$ is any subgroup of $G$ such that $S \subseteq H$, then $\langle S \rangle \subseteq H$

A group $G$ is *cyclic* if there exists $g \in G$ such that $\langle g \rangle = G$.

---

Suppose $S = \{g\}$ consists of a single element. We have $\langle g \rangle = \{g^n \mid b \in \mathbb Z\}$.

---

We say that an element $g \in G$ has *finite order* if there exists $k \in \mathbb N$ such that $g^k = e$. Otherwise, we say that g has infinite order.

If $g$ has finite order, we define $o(g)$ (the *order* of g) to be the smallest $k \in \mathbb N$ such that $g^k = e$. (This exists by the well-ordering property of $\mathbb N$.)

## (Group homo)morphisms

Let $G$ and $H$ be groups. A function $f: G \to H$ is a (group) *isomorphism* if $f$ is bijective and $f(g_1g_2) = f(g_1)f(g_2)$ for all $g_1, g_2 \in G$. We write $G \cong H$.

A function $f: G \to H$ is a group **homomorphism** if $f(g_1g_2) = f(g_1)f(g_2)$ for all $g_1, g_2 \in G$.
