# Hash Tables

Hash Table:

- Dictionary
- Insertion: $O(1)$ average - only when collisions are minimized
- Searching: $O(1)$ average - only when collisions are minimized
- $O(1)$ when there are no collisions

## Linear Chaining

**Linear chaining** uses linked lists to store colliding keys.

## Linear Probing

**Linear probing** places the colliding key in the _next available space_.

## Double Hashing

**Double hashing** hashes the key again upon collision.
